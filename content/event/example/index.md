summary: A Public Talk for 200+ people on how the brain creates our reality.
abstract: "Imagine your entire life, everything you see, hear, and feel, as a first-person movie. Your brain is the director, producer, and cinema all in one, and you’re the only person in the audience! Is the movie your brain is showing you real? Is it a live recording or a Hollywood production? The things we see around us are real...most of the time. But sometimes, your brain likes to play tricks on you. Have you ever seen a face in the clouds or been fooled by an illusion or a magic trick? They aren’t just silly mistakes; they are amazing clues that show us how the brain creates our personal movie. Illusions teach us that your brain isn't just a camera recording the world. In this talk, I walk you through these ideas and what they can teach us about robot intelligence."
